# The Office GIF Portal (Backend)

This repo is the backend for The Office GIF Portal made using Solana Pay, Rust and React. The front-end is on a replit website which can be found [here](https://replit.com/@RoshanThomas2/Solana-Project-Web3?v=1). 

## About the Project

The portal is a way for users to store their rare collections of GIFs online fast and securely. With very low gas fees of Solana it can store your GIFs on your account with very minimal effort. 

Currently, the app takes a GIPHY link and it stores that GIF onto your account which can be viewed whenever you visit the site. The front-end is built primarily using React, and the backend is a mix between Anchor, Javascript and Rust.
